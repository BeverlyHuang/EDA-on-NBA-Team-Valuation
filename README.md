# NBA Team Valuation

By Beverly Huang

### Goal
With NBA Team data collected, we want to explore the relationship between team valuation and other variables and figure out what are the significant variables to predict team valuation.

### Conclusion
Team valuation is highly correlated with attendance, salary, ELO and housing price. Thus, in the future, we can use these four features to analyze and valuate an NBA team. To increase value of a team, we can consider increasing attendance rate of games, increasing salary for players or improving performance of the team.
